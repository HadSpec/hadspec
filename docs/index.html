  <p>
  The Hadron Spectrum Collaboration (hadspec) makes use of the
  numerical approach to Quantum Chromodynamics known as lattice QCD to
  study the spectrum of hadrons. An international collaboration of
  scientists in Europe, the US and India, we aim to understand how
  quarks and gluons confine themselves within the strongly interacting
  mesons and baryons observed in nature.

        <b>Scalar and tensor charmonium resonances computed from QCD</b>
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
     Using lattice QCD, scalar and tensor charmonium resonances have been determined from coupled-channel scattering amplitudes. Unstable charmonium resonances are readily observed at modern hadron physics experiments but often produce puzzling features. This new work demonstrates that by using QCD, and constraints between scattering amplitudes such as unitarity, features observed in different decay modes can be unified into a single description of a complex resonance pole coupled to multiple channels.

        <b>Hadspec calculates three-pion scattering amplitude</b>
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
     For the first time in lattice QCD, a three-hadron scattering amplitude has been determined using a general workflow that does not make use of model assumptions or a perturbative expansion. Focusing on the maximum isospin three-pion channel ($\pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^+ \to \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^+$) the calculation uses a relativistic finite-volume formalism to relate lattice energies to the physical scattering amplitude.

        <b>Hadspec studies decays of a $1^{-+}$ hybrid meson</b>
      </h3>
      <br/>
      <p>
      For the first time in lattice QCD, a calculation has shown the
 presence of an exotic $1^{-+}$ state appearing as an unstable
 <i>resonance</i>. The result shows that the longstanding model-based
 proposal that such a state would couple more strongly to the $\pi
 b_1$ final-state than the lower-lying $\pi \eta, \pi \eta'$ and $\pi
 \rho$ final-states is confirmed. Possible implications for the
 recently observed $\pi_1$ experimental candidate state are discussed. The calculation appears in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10034.pdf"
 style="text-decoration:none">preprint posted to the arXiv</a>,
 and has been accepted for publication in Physical Review D.

 We present a method for efficiently finding solutions of Luescher’s
 quantization condition, the equation which relates two-particle
 scattering amplitudes to the discrete spectrum of states in a
 periodic spatial volume of finite extent such as that present in
 lattice QCD. The approach proposed is based on an eigenvalue
 decomposition in the space of coupled-channels and partial-waves,
 which proves to have several desirable and simplifying features that
 are of great benefit when considering problems beyond simple elastic
 scattering of spinless particles.

      light quark masses has been selected by the Editors to appear on
      the front-page of the PRD website. The results of the
      calculation show that in the scalar sector a stable $\sigma$-like
      state appears, along with an $f_0(980)$-like resonance
      appearing at the $K\overline{K}$ threshold, while in the tensor
      sector, two resonances are observed, one decaying dominantly
      into $\pi\pi$ and the other into $K\overline{K}$.
