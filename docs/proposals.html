<h3>2013-2014</h3>

<p>
  In order to really understand QCD and hence test whether it is the complete theory of the strong
  interaction, we must determine the spectrum of mesons and baryons that it implies and test those
  spectra against high quality experimental measurements. The complete combined analysis of available
  experimental data on the photoproduction of nucleon resonances, and the measurement of the
  electromagnetic properties of the low-lying baryons are the HP3 and HP7 DOE milestones in hadronic
  physics, with theory support integral to the current and future experimental program; the experimental
  investigation of the meson resonance spectrum, and in particular the search for mesons with
  exotic quantum numbers, is the aim of the GlueX Collaboration at JLab@12GeV, and the target of
  a new milestone HP15 (2018).
</p>
<p>
  Given the current intense experimental efforts in hadron spectroscopy, the need to predict and
  understand the hadron spectrum from first principles calculations in QCD is clear. Hence, we have
  a multi-year program aimed at a comprehensive study of the meson and baryon resonance spectrum, with the
  continuum quantum numbers of the extracted states reliably identified.
</p>
<p>
  Beyond determining the excited-state spectrum, we aim to explore the properties of some of these
  states through the investigation of the electromagnetic form factors and transition matrix elements,
  providing vital input to experimental studies for both baryons and mesons, for exampling by informaing 
  expected production rates at GlueX.  Our program exploits the anisotropic clover gauge configurations, 
  designed for spectroscopy, generated under the proposal of 
  <a href="http://usqcd.jlab.org/projects/AnisoGen/">Edwards et al.</a>.
