      <p>We are an international collaboration of researchers who work to deepen knowledge and understanding of the strong force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, through rigorous computation of the spectrum of particles held together by this force, the <i>hadrons</i>.</p>

  <p>Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong force, which is expressed in terms of fundamental particles called quarks and gluons. Hadrons are built out of these basic building blocks, with QCD acting to <i>confine</i> the color-charged quarks and gluons within hadrons through a mechanism that is not yet fully understood. QCD is a strongly-coupled quantum field theory for which established analytical tools are not applicable. Our primary method to extract measurable quantities from QCD in a rigorous, systematically-improvable manner is Lattice QCD, where correlation functions in a discretised finite space-time volume can be computed by Monte-Carlo sampling possible field configurations using high-performance computing.
</p>

<p> We have pioneered novel techniques within lattice QCD that have allowed us access to previously unexplored areas of the hadron spectrum. Highlights include: the developement of an operator construction technology, known as <i>distillation</i>, which makes possible the efficient computation of a wide variety of correlation functions; utilization of GPUs to compute quark propagation from all timeslices of a lattice, allowing us to study processes where quarks and antiquarks annihilate; the use of large bases of single-meson and multi-meson operators in correlation functions, from which robust excited state spectra may be extracted through variation analysis; determination of <i>coupled-channel</i> scattering amplitudes using extensions of the finite-volume formalism originally derived by L&uuml;scher. 
</p>

<p> We are interested in all aspects of the spectrum and interactions of hadrons, be they constructed from light or heavy quarks, and continue to perform calculations of hadrons that can be observed at current and future experimental facilities.
</p>

<p> Our collaboration spans several institutions in the US and Europe, with a <a href="people.html">membership</a> of senior scientists, early career researchers and graduate students. We are <a href="support.html">supported</a> by external and internal grants, and we obtain allocations at leadership-class computing facilities through competitive calls-for-proposals. We publish our <a href="publications.html">results</a> in refereed scientific journals.

A simple picture of the hadron spectrum 

  Through the quark model we can understand many states low in the spectrum as being composed of $q$ and $\bar{q}$ building blocks, and much of that spectrum can be divided into $q\bar{q}$ and $qqq$-like objects, however other colour-singlet combinations are possible, like four-quark states or states with intrinsic glue. Where and how these might arise in the spectrum remains a mystery, although there are distinct experimental hints in both the light and charm-quark energy regions.</p>

      <p>QCD is a strongly-coupled quantum field theory at the energies where hadron arise and is thus computationally very challenging. Our primary method to extract measurable quantities from QCD in a rigorous, systematically-improvable manner is Lattice QCD, whereby we calculate the correlation functions of the quantum field theory in a discretised finite volume using computers. We have made use of several innovative techniques, one that has proven instrumental is <i>distillation</i>, which is a quark-field smearing method that enables efficient computation of the all of the possible particle propagation paths demanded by QCD.</p>

      <p>Our collaboration focuses on testing the realm of possibility within lattice QCD, by attempting to compute new and difficult quantities. One of the early contributions of this collaboration was the construction of a large basis of operators including some resembling hybrid mesons - mesons with intrinsic gluonic components, enabling the computation of supermultiplets of hybrid mesons directly from QCD. This work was repeated for all the combinations of light, strange and charm quarks, and in baryonic quantum numbers, leading to the prediction of a rich hybrid spectrum awaiting discovery.</p>

      <p>The vast majority of the states of interest in the hadron spectrum are resonances, they are observed as resonant enhancements in the scattering amplitudes of the lighter stable hadrons that trigger particle detectors. Multiple channels are often present, which introduce thresholds and inter-channel couplings that are of vital importance in understanding many of the excited hadrons observed in recent years. Through a mapping originally derived by L&uuml;scher and extended by many others it is possible to connect the finite volume spectrum obtained in a lattice QCD calculation to the infinite volume scattering amplitudes observed experimentally. This has been our focus in recent years, and we were the first group to obtain coupled-channel scattering amplitudes in this way.</p>

      <p>We continue to compute further quantities of interest that can be observed at current and upcoming experimental facilities.
